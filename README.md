# gressholmen pilot study

Unfinished scripts for a planned but discontinued manuscript for my PhD project. Data come from the ARKO project, and my own field work on Gressholmen. For more info, see data paper (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7304386), [an associated repo for the data paper](https://github.com/evalieungh/gressholmen_data), or just ask me.

Project started summer 2018. Older data and GIS files mentioned in the scripts stem from ARKO project at NINA.
