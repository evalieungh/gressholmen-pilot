# gressholmen pilot study

Unfinished scripts for a planned manuscript for my PhD project. This project is unlikely to be worked on further, at least in the near future, but I'm keeping the scripts here as a backup and to document some possible directions forward with the data set. 

Data come from the ARKO project, and my own field work on Gressholmen. For more info, see  [the data paper](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.10.e94057), [an associated repo for the data paper](https://github.com/evalieungh/gressholmen_data), or just ask me.

Project started summer 2018. Older data and GIS files mentioned in the scripts stem from ARKO project at NINA.
